Thanks for your interest!

## Dev conventions
- Keep controllers thin; move logic to Services.
- Test ingestion/chunking with small docs first.
- Document new endpoints in `docs/api.http` and ensure Swagger reflects changes.

## Branching
- `main`: stable
- `feat/<name>` and `fix/<name>` for changes
